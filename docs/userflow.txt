## Overall Flow Considerations

- **Validation & Exception Handling:**  
  Each module implements robust validation (e.g., ensuring valid time slots, non-conflicting appointments) and exception handling via a centralized error handler. Any validation errors result in clear error messages displayed to the user.

- **Audit and Logging:**  
  All critical actions (CRUD operations, logins, changes) are recorded by the UserLog Management system to maintain an audit trail. This allows the admin to review actions performed by staff.

- **Notification System:**  
  The system integrates with SMS/email services. After a booking is made or an appointment is updated/cancelled, notifications are automatically sent to the involved parties.

- **Role-Based Access:**  
  - The Admin module has access to all operations.
  - The Staff module is restricted to operations that affect their own schedule, appointments, and profile.
  - The Client module provides read-only access to staff and service details with booking privileges.

- **Integration Points:**  
  - **Media Management:** Ensures that images and videos for services are stored and retrievable.
  - **Calendar & Scheduling:** Provides a unified view of appointments across all staff, ensuring no conflicts.
  - **Settings:** Offers global and personal configuration options that can be extended as the application scales.
